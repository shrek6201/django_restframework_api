# django_restframework_api
This is my first self built API, based on  Django REST Framework.
I built this API using Python Django in a virtual environment.
First you have to activate the virtual environment you created using ".venv\scripts\activate". 
This creates a manage.py file in your root directory, which is kinda a main file for your project.
Then you have to run the server using "python manage.py runserver".
After this, you can start working on your project whilst viewing the changes being made on the django rest framework admin panel.
